# Welcome to Game of Code 2016!
## A competition for software developers to win £100,000

Follow [@TheHutGroup](https://twitter.com/TheHutGroup) on Twitter and [subscribe on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gameofcode) for competition news and updates.

On behalf of everyone at The Hut Group we’d like to thank you for entering our competition and wish you best of luck on your journey ahead. You’ll need skill, you’ll need strength, you’ll need an endless supply of Red Bull or alternative-energy-drink-that-is-readily-available-in-all-good-highstreet-shops. But most of all you’ll need an almighty idea.

An idea so jaw-droppingly powerful that visiting Heads of State feel nervous and a bit twitchy in its presence; an idea so mind-blowingly brilliant that bottom lips across the whole of Silicon Valley will start to wobble; an idea so incredibly simple that there won’t be a brick wall in Seattle that doesn’t have someone banging their head against it.

An idea we love so much **we’ll give you £100,000**.

You’ll find everything you need to complete your quest right here, so have a look around and if you’ve any questions you can contact our team at [gameofcode@thehutgroup.com](mailto:gameofcode@thehutgroup.com)

## The short story

Game of Code is your quest to build an app for the health and beauty sector and win yourself £100,000. There are two phases – the first is to submit a proposal of your app, and the second is to develop that idea into a working prototype. Only successful entries from the first phase will be required to develop their apps for the second. It is open anyone aged 18 or over who is domiciled in the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland) for the duration the Competition and entries can be submitted by individuals or by a team of up to five members. The best prototypes (to be decided by a public vote) will be invited to the grand final where a panel of judges and industry experts will decide on the winner of the £100,000 prize.
